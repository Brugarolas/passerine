    /// counter = 7

    ///     var<`b> = var<`a> + 1
    ///     var<`b>
    /// }

    ///
    /// There are still many optimizations that can be made,
    /// but needless to say, Passerine uses dynamically inferred lifetimes
    /// in lieu of garbage collecting.

    /// TODO: closures
    /// The issue with closures is that they allow the data to escape
    /// which makes vaporization less useful as a result.
    /// There are a few potential solutions:
    /// - The easiest solution is to disallow closures. This is lame.
    /// - The second easiest solution is to simply copy the data
    ///   when creating a closure.
    ///   While easy to implement, captured values would not represent
    ///   the same object:
    ///   ```plain
    ///   counter = start -> {
    ///       value = start
    ///       increment = () -> { value = value + 1 }
    ///       decrement = () -> { value = value - 1 }
    ///       (increment, decrement)
    ///   }
    ///   ```
    ///   If a counter was constructed using the above code,
    ///   increment and decrement would refer to different values.
    /// - As closures are a poor man's object,
    ///   an alternative would be adding support for pseudo-objects via macros.
    ///   this wouldn't clash with naÃ¯eve closure implementations;
    ///   here's what I'm getting at:
    ///   ```plain
    ///   counter = start -> {
    ///       Counter start -- wrap value in Label, creating a type
    ///   }
    ///
    ///   increment = value: Counter _ ~> { value = value + 1 }
    ///   decrement = value: Counter _ ~> { value = value - 1 }
    ///   tally     = Counter value -> value
    ///
    ///   my_counter = counter 5
    ///   increment counter; increment counter
    ///   decrement counter
    ///   print (tally counter)
    ///   ```
    ///   I like this solution, but I think it should be its own thing
    ///   rather than boot actual closures from the language.
    ///   Passerine's an impure functional language,
    ///   so no closures would be a little silly.
    /// - Another solution would be to store the values on the heap, arc'd.
    ///   Nah.
    /// - Ok, I think I've got it.
    ///   At compile time, each function contains a list of variables
    ///   of the environment it's created in, ad infinitum.
    ///   When a function is defined within a function (read closure),
    ///   during definition, it marks all variables used by that function.
    ///   At the end of the original function, all unmarked (read uncaptured)
    ///   variables are removed from the environment,
    ///   And all functions return containing an ARC to the base function's environment
    /// - I noticed an issue. Take this example:
    ///   ```plain
    ///   escape = huge tiny -> {
    ///       forget   = () -> huge,
    ///       remember = () -> tiny
    ///       remember
    ///   }
    ///   ```
    ///   In this case, `huge` is captured by the `forget closure`
    ///   But only remember is returned.
    ///   However, everything is stored in the same struct
    ///   So huge isn't deallocated until remember is.
    /// - Here's my Final Solution. We introduce a new type of data,
    ///   `ReferenceCoutned`.
    ///   When data is captured, it's converted to reference-counted data
    ///   if it hasn't been already, and the reference count is increased.
    ///   The only downside is that this is a bit slower,
    ///   but it's a small price to pay for salvation.
